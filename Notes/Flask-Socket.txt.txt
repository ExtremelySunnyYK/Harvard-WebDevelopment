FLASK SOCKET


<<<Javascript Operators>>>

socket.on()
	event listener

socket.send() or socket.emit()
	The send() function sends a standard message of string or JSON type to the client. The emit() function sends a message under a custom event name( in here it’s ‘my event’ ) along with the data.

e.g 

On triggering ‘my event’, the ‘handle_my_custom_event’ view firstly receives the json objects, prints it on the terminal and later sends it to the ‘my response’ event. ‘callback’ is kind of debugging technique which helps us in getting to know if the message is received by the server and henceforth, calls the function ‘messageReceived’.

	@socketio.on('my event') #event handler declaration
	def handle_my_custom_event(json, methods=['GET', 'POST']):
	    print('received my event: '+ str(json))

	    socketio.emit('my response', json, callback=messageReceived) #sending message
